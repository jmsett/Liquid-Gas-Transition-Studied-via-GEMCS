# Liquid-Gas-Transition-Studied-via-GEMCS
The main idea of the project is to investigate the liquid-gas transition of a fore-shifted Lenard-Jones particle system via Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo simulations.
In particular, we wish to determine the system's liquid-gas binodal in the temperature-density plane and the phase diagram in the pressure-temperature plane.
We will compare the obtained binodal with results from the literature, and we will discuss the behavior around the critical point in light of the van der Waals
equation of state.
